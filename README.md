## Introduction

Tap&Go integrates Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to enrich the customer-business interaction. This innovative system empowers businesses with instant customer feedback directly through Google Maps and TripAdvisor. By tapping an NFC-enabled Tap&Go card, customers are directed to review platforms while the system captures crucial data such as IP, operating system, and location, available via a control panel for business owners. The Tap&Go solution is designed for speed, SEO optimization, exceptional design, and robust performance.

## Key Features

- **NFC Feedback System**: A tap from an NFC card allows customers to quickly leave reviews.
- **Valuable Insights**: The control panel provides business owners with real-time data analytics.
- **Customizable Landing Page**: Owners can modify the loading page connected to their review link for brand consistency.
- **Cocktail Recommendation System**: An interactive feature enhancing the pub experience with personalized cocktail suggestions.
- **Instagram Discount Offers**: A social media integration that provides discounts for customer shares, automated for efficiency.
